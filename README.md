### Create a New OIDC App in Okta

If you don't have an Okta developer account, please [create one](https://developer.okta.com/signup/). Then, create a new OIDC app on Okta:

1. Log in to your developer account, navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**.
3. Select **Single-Page App** > **Next**. 
4. Give the application a name, change all instances of `https://localhost:8080` to `https://localhost:4200`, and click **Done**.

#### Server Configuration

Set your domain and copy the `clientId` into `server/src/main/resources/application.properties`. 

**NOTE:** The value of `{yourOktaDomain}` should be something like `dev-123456.okta.com`. Make sure you don't include `-admin` in the value!

```properties
okta.oauth2.client-id: {clientId}
okta.oauth2.issuer: https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
```

#### Client Configuration

For the client, set the `issuer` and copy the `clientId` into `client/src/app/auth-routing.module.ts`.

```typescript
const config = {
  issuer: 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default',
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/implicit/callback',
  clientId: '{clientId}'
};
```
